  Hello friends and onlookers,<br><br>
  </div>
  Hmm, where to start? My name is Schuyler Meyer (pronounced like "Sky - ler My - er").
  <br><br>
  My ultimate goal is to create immersive experiences. Whether they be happy and exciting for people to relive or escape to,
  more sensitive and emotional for people to better understand the struggles of others or to learn about history past, or
  simply awe-inspiring and epic. The tools used could be any number of things, such as virtual or augmented reality, in the
  form of a video game or animation, or just a basic photograph.
  <br><br>
  I, myself, am always fascinated and inspired by those that are able to create or capture the emotions of their subject
  and environment, in any multitude of forms - game, movie, book, photograph, etc.
  <br><br>
  As for the more tangible stuff, I recently graduated from Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY with a bachelor's degree in
  software engineering and one class short of another degree in digital arts and sciences (to which I plan on finishing soon).
  While there, I worked on some really cool projects - both for research and class as well as for fun. As one of the
  student photographers for the school (both marketing and athletic departments), I also did a lot with photography.
  I probably missed out on one or more social events because I was always editing photos. And I even got to TA a photography class.
  <br><br>
  I was also an officer (or E-Board as we called it) for four different student run clubs - Baseball Club (Historian,
  Photographer, Webmaster), Video Game Club [CUGI] (Treasurer), Photo Club (Secretary), and Anime Club (Secretary) -
  as well as the team photographer for the Men's and Women's Club Hockey teams.
